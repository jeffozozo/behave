Feature: Peppers Ghost DIY Project with custom steps
    As a person who likes Halloween
    I want to ensure my peppers ghost diy site has pictures on it
    So that people can use it to build their own ghost scene

Scenario:
    Given I open the instructables peppers ghost page
    Then I expect that there is at least one picture there
